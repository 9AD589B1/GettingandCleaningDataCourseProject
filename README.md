# GettingandCleaningDataCourseProject
Contains code and documentation for the "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project" from the Coursera Data Science Specialization 

The CodeBook.md file contains descriptions of the variable names contained in the output from run_analysis.R

The R script run_analysis.R will load, clean, merge and perform calculations on a test and training data set from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 

There are four main blocks to this script:
	* The first block prepares the column headers for both the Test and Training sets
	* The second block prepares the test data
	* The third block prepares the training data
	* The fourth block creates a data set by combining the Test and Training sets, and calculates means on mean and std variables
